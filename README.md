Harvard CS50P: Introduction to Programming with Python

#### [CS50P](https://bit.ly/3VOYzpd)

CS50P
an introductory python programming course that teaches students how to read and write code as well as how to test and "debug" it. ten weeks with weekly lectures and problem sets with a final project (i will finish discogskii before starting this final project). my idea for a final project is a financial report generator. pull data from a financial endpoint such as IEX, generate plots and statistics, then write that to a pdf with a module such as fpdf2.
